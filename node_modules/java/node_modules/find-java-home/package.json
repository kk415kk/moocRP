  "readme": "#node-find-java-home\n\nReturns the location of JAVA_HOME as an absolute path on windows, mac, and \nlinux.  It runs asynchronously.\n\n##Algorithm\n1. This module will first attempt to check for JAVA_HOME.  If that's set it\nsimply returns that value.  \n2. On windows the registry is queried.\n3. If neither of the previous methods worked, then the PATH is scanned for javac\n4. On mac, the parent directory of javac is checked for a java_home binary.  If that binary exists then it is executed and the result is used\n5. The grandparent directory of javac is used.  This is similar to `$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink $(which javac))))`\n\n##Example\n````javascript\nrequire('find-java-home')(function(err, home){\n  if(err)return console.log(err);\n  console.log(home);\n});\n````\n\n##License\n````\nCopyright 2013 Joseph Spencer.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n````\n",
